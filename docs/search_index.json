I totally get you! I had my initial hesitation to embrace R, with Râ€™s reputation of having a steep learning curve, especially for people with no background in coding or programming such as me. A couple of years down the road now, I can confidently tell you, to learn R is one of the best decisions I made during my PhD. I started off thinking I would just plot some graphs using R, and I would still do everything else in SPSS or excel. Well, now pretty much the opposite is true: I always prefer to stay in R unless I absolutely have to move elsewhere (thanks Tidyverse, you changed my life once and for all :))). This is not to say that learning R is going to be easy but one thing I can guarantee you is that your threshold for feeling awesome will be reduced to a record low once you start playing with coding in R: I never thought adding an error bar or a percentage label on a bar plot could generate so much happiness for me!:)))) "],["the-pool-of-tears.html", "Chapter 2 The pool of tears", " Chapter 2 The pool of tears "],["a-caucus-race-and-a-long-tale.html", "Chapter 3 A caucus-race and a long tale", " Chapter 3 A caucus-race and a long tale "]]
